#Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## Description
This project is a **full machine learning pipeline** built on the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).  
The goal is to analyze patient health data and predict the risk of heart disease using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
